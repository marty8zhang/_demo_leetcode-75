# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

[LeetCode Problem Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from
the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

# Examples

## Example 1

```text
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

## Example 2

```text
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

# Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`.
